# Predicting-Laptop-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict laptop prices using machine learning. With 1,275 laptops and 23 features like brand, RAM, CPU, and storage, we use linear regression to build a model. The goal is to help consumers find fair prices, assist retailers in pricing, and guide manufacturers on key price-driving specs.
# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the price of laptops based on their hardware specifications using a supervised learning approach, specifically **Linear Regression**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset Size:** 1,275 laptop models
- **Features:** 23 attributes including brand, screen size, RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, operating system, and more
- **Target Variable:** Price (in Euros)
- **Goal:** Build a model that accurately estimates laptop prices

## 🎯 Objectives

- Help **consumers** find fair laptop prices based on configurations
- Assist **retailers** in setting competitive prices
- Enable **manufacturers** to identify key features that drive pricing

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Used:** Linear Regression
- **Steps:**
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Selection & Encoding
  - Model Training & Evaluation
  - Price Prediction & Visualization

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, train_test_split, etc.)


## ✅ Results

- The model achieved strong performance in predicting laptop prices.
- Linear Regression identified RAM, brand, CPU, and storage type as key influencers.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Try advanced regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add more features like battery life, display resolution
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
