# Predicting-Laptop-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict laptop prices using machine learning. With 1,275 laptops and 23 features like brand, RAM, CPU, and storage, we use linear regression to build a model. The goal is to help consumers find fair prices, assist retailers in pricing, and guide manufacturers on key price-driving specs.
